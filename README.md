# vivify_MailRobbery_qbtarget
vivify_MailRobbery-main

This is not my script but a mod on the script vivify_MailRobbery to work with qb-target.  

This script allows you to rob mailboxes with a cool down on each mailbox and it gives you items, some of which you can open (like letter) that can then contain some valubles inside.

these can then be "sold" to a local in a specified location.  It gives black money, but can be modified to give you another currency if you so desire.

I honestly cant remember where I got the script from originally, but more than willing to place the link to the origianl here if I can find it or if you can provide me with it, even better :)
